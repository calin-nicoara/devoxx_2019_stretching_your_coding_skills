### Calculations: National Insurance contributions and Tax (Tax Year 2016-17)
 
   National Insurance contributions are made up of three bands. It is a deductible and computed as a sum of the contributions for every band the gross salary is applicable for.
   Further examples on how it is computed for various salaries can be found in the [Examples: National Insurance contributions and Tax calculations](#examples-national-insurance-contributions-and-tax-calculations) table 
   towards the lower power of this page. Below are the definitions of the bands for the UK:
      
   ```
         ---------------------+-------------------------+--------
         Band                 | NI deductible income    | NI Rate
         ---------------------+-------------------------+--------
         No contributions     | Up to £8,060.00         |    0%
         Basic contributions  | £8,060.00 to £43,000.00 |   12%
         Higher contributions | over £43,000.00         |    2%
         ---------------------+-------------------------+--------
   ```
   **Note:** for each of the above bands, NI deductible income is accounted for, starting from and including the first penny (1p) earned above the lower-limit, up to and including the higher-limit specified. 
 
  Tax payable is made up of four bands. It is a deductible and computed as a sum of the tax payable for every band the gross salary is applicable for.
  Further examples on how it is computed for various salaries can be found in the [Examples: National Insurance contributions and Tax calculations](#examples-national-insurance-contributions-and-tax-calculations) table 
  towards the lower power of this page. Below are the definitions of the bands for the UK:
     
   ```
         ---------------------+---------------------------+---------
         Band                 | Taxable income            | Tax rate
         ---------------------+---------------------------+---------
         Personal Allowance*  | Up to £11,000.00          |    0%
         Basic rate           | £11,000.00 to £43,000.00  |   20%
         Higher rate          | £43,000.00 to £150,000.00 |   40%
         Additional rate      | over £150,000.00          |   45%
         ---------------------+---------------------------+---------
   ```
   *past an Annual Gross Salary of £100,000.00, the personal allowance rules change i.e. for every extra £2 earned, the personal allowance reduces by £1. Past an annual gross salary of £122,000.00, NO personal allowance is applicable. And this excess is taxed at the Higher rate tax.

   **Note:** for each of the above bands, taxable income is accounted for, starting from and including the first penny (1p) earned above the lower-limit, up to and including the higher-limit specified.
   
   ```
        National Insurance contributions = sum of the contributions accumulated by the two contribution bands
       
        Tax payable = sum of all the tax payable accumulated by the three tax bands 
       
        Total deductibles = National Insurance contributions + Tax payable
   ```
